Hey there! 👋
---
I'm Kyōko, an aspiring software developer / engineer based in Germany.

I build whatever comes to mind, or whatever my friends would like to have, as well as school assignments/projects.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is Linux, c++ and rust with several libaries for example a lot of expierience with rust GUIs using egui or gtk or the actix web framework for http servers in rust.
I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the [3d Jump 'n run in c++](https://github.com/KyokoSpl/cpp_3d_jump).

I’ve built over 16 public repos, but privately there are some more.

If you want to learn how i do it, my books and course are available here!
Fun Facts:

    I love monster energy and coffee
    Alice in Borderlands is my favourite series
    Hobbies: going to concerts, gaming, building things
